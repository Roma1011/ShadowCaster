# ShadowCaster :moyai:

# Description The project is a C# application that involves mapping objects between different types using custom ShadowCaster. The ShadowCaster  provides functionality to map properties from a source object to a destination object, with options to control the character casing of property names and the types of members to include in the mapping (properties, fields, or both).
